Usage
=====

* Generate `Makefile.inc` using `configure`. For example, if `Pythia8` is located in `/usr/local`,

```
./configure --enable-64bit --enable-shared --prefix=/usr/local
```

`configure --help` will show other options.

* Edit `ttbar.cc`.

* Run `make`.

* If every step above was successful, an executable `ttbar` would be produced. The events can be generated by running

```
./ttbar test.lhe 1000 > test.log
```
