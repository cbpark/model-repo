Usage 1
========

* [Pythia 8](http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html) with the version >= 8.2 must be installed.

* Generate `Makefile.inc` using `configure`. For example, if `Pythia8` is located in `/usr/local`,

```
./configure --enable-64bit --enable-shared --prefix=/usr/local
```

`configure --help` will show other options.

* Edit `gg_H_hh.cc`.

* Run `make`.

* If every step above was successful, an executable `gg_H_hh` would be produced. The events can be generated by running

```
./gg_H_hh test.lhe 1000 > test.log
```


Usage 2 : Run for cluster 
=========================

$ ./configure.sh
$ make

: This builds the executable '<model>_cluster'
: Then, modify the job submission script - 'qsub_pythia8.sh', with proper env. variables and running arguments.
: And, submit by

$ qsub -q compute-all-high ./qsub_pythia8.sh

: Check the job status by

$ watch qstat -f
